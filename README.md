# Component + assets problem

Is there a way to publish a component with some attached assets, in a way that doesn’t require:

- An extra configuration / build step (e.g. copying the assets + telling the component where to find them).
- A specific bundler (e.g. by importing the non-JS assets from the JS code, à la webpack / parcel / others).
